Description
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------



The Thrustmaster HOTAS Warthog "Universal HID Mapping" is an advanced 
programming TARGET script which provides enhanced mapping using only HID (DX) 
buttons. The HID buttons (DX) based mapping allow to use the same profile for 
several games or situations, since all buttons can be assigned directly in 
your favorite game(s).

While the standard mapping is limited to 32 HID buttons, this script takes 
advantage of an hidden Thrustmaster's driver capability which allow to 
emulate up to 120 HID buttons with 8 POV Hat positions. This profile currently 
use 86 buttons with 8 POV hat positions.
